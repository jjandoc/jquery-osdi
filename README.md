# jQuery-OSDI
The jQuery OSDI plugin implements non-authenticated POST via AJAX against OSDI-compliant API endpoints. It can be used to send in data to OSDI-compliant APIs.

*Version 1.1.0*

This plugin is free and open source, and licensed under the [MIT open source license](https://github.com/opensupporter/jquery-osdi/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

# Overview & Requirements

The jQuery OSDI plugin attaches to form DOM markup and processes form input to send to OSDI-compliant APIs via AJAX. It can be used to create frontend forms that submit data over an OSDI-complaint API to a remote server.

The plugin makes use of OSDI's non-authenticated POST features, so an API key or other type of authentication is not required, making this plugin suitable for frontend implementations.

The plugin expects to POST to one of the OSDI helper endpoints, which can accept non-authenticated POSTs according to the spec. For more information about the OSDI format, see [the documentation here](http://opensupporter.github.io/osdi-docs/).

The jQuery OSDI plugin is called on form tags. It can automatically pick up data from the form tag and underlying inputs, in which case special input names are used, or you can specify exactly the body to use in the form of a function that returns JSON to be POSTed via AJAX. Additional options and AJAX callback handlers can be added as well.

The jQuery OSDI plugin requires jQuery version 1.8 or later.

# Basic Usage & Demo



Include jQuery and the plugin javascript file, then call the jQuery OSDI plugin on a form:

```javascript
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script> 
<script src="jquery.osdi.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

<script type="text/javascript">
$(document).ready(function() {
	$('form').osdi();
});
</script>
```

A demo with more examples is available [here](http://opensupporter.github.io/jquery-osdi/demo.html).

# Options

The jQuery OSDI plugin can take various options on initialization. Typically, options can be passed on initialization, or can be passed as functions, which are called when the form is submitted. This is useful if you want to dynamically populate options on submit. 

The available options are:


| Name          | Type        | Default         | Description
|-----------    |----------   |--------------   |--------------
|endpoint		|string     |Your form's <code>action</code> attribute.	| The endpoint to POST to. Can optionally take a function that returns a string.
|body		|JSON object     |Created from your form's inputs. (See [below](#form-input-names) for special naming conventions.)	| The JSON that will be POSTed to the endpoint. Should be valid OSDI for the endpoint, typically OSDI helper POST format containing at least a person object. [See the OSDI documentation form more information and examples.](http://opensupporter.github.io/osdi-docs/) If not present, a body will be created from your form inputs. Can optionally take a function that returns a JSON object. (See [below](#form-input-names) for more information.)
|status		|string/boolean     |subscribed	|The email subscription status the server should be asked to set the person to. Valid options typically are: `"subscribed"`, `"unsubscribed"`, `"bouncing"`, `"spam complaint"`. Use `false` to pass no status, which typically means the person's current status will be unchanged by the server. Can optionally take a function that returns a string/boolean. (Ignored if `body` is present.)
|autoresponse		|boolean     |true	| Whether the receiving server should asked to send an email autoresponse. Can optionally take a function that returns a boolean. (Ignored if `body` is present.)
|add_tags		|array     |	| An array of tags the server should be asked to add to the person. Can optionally take a function that returns an array. (Ignored if `body` is present.)
|immediate      |boolean   | false    | Whether the AJAX POST should be called immediately or rather attached as a submit event to the form, to be called when the form is submitted. Calling immediately is useful when using other plugins that attach to the form submit event, such as validation plugins, where you can immediately call the AJAX POST if the form is valid.
|done		|function     |	| A function to be executed after a successful AJAX POST. A passthrough for jQuery's [.done](http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/) callback. Can have the same arguments, <code>data</code>, <code>textStatus</code>, and <code>jqXHR</code>.
|fail		|function     |	| A function to be executed after a failed AJAX POST. A passthrough for jQuery's [.fail](http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/) callback. Can have the same arguments, <code>jqXHR</code>, <code>textStatus</code>, and <code>errorThrown</code>.
|always		|function     |	| A function to be executed after an AJAX POST, no matter success or failure. A passthrough for jQuery's [.always](http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/) function. Can have the same arguments, <code>data/jqXHR</code>, <code>textStatus</code>, and <code>jqXHR/errorThrown</code>.
|ajax_options		|JSON object     | { type: "POST", dataType: 'json', contentType: 'application/json'}	| An object to be passed through to jQuery's <code>$.ajax()</code> function. See [jQuery's documentation](http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/) for available options. Can optionally take a function that returns a JSON object.

# Form Input Names

If you omit the <code>body</code> option, the jQuery OSDI plugin will attempt to create an OSDI-compliant JSON body to POST for you, using the inputs in your form. Specifically, it will create an inline [person object](http://opensupporter.github.io/osdi-docs/people.html) to use as part of the OSDI helper format. Use these special names on your form inputs to tell the plugin which input corresponds to which piece of data:

| Form Name          | OSDI Field      | Description
|-----------    |-----------|--------------
|given_name		|given_name     |The person's first name.
|family_name		|family_name     |The person's last name.
|email_address		|email_addresses[address]     |The person's email address.
|street		|postal_addresses[address_lines[]]     |The person's street address.
|locality		|postal_addresses[locality]     |The person's city or other local administrative area.
|region		|postal_addresses[region]     |State or subdivision codes according to ISO 3166-2 (Final 2 alpha digits).
|postal_code		|postal_addresses[postal_code]     |The region specific postal code, such as a zip code.
|country		|postal_addresses[country]     |The country code according to ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2.
|phone_number		|phone_numbers[number]     |The phone number of the person. Must including country code and must be numeric characters only.
|custom[key]		|custom_fields.key			|A custom field for the person. Form name should be the key associated with this custom field, bracketed and prefixed by "custom", e.g. <code>custom[member_number]</code>.
